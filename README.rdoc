= Double Agent

double_agent is a library for parsing browser and operating system info out of user 
agent strings. It is designed for parsing large sets at once for review or analysis.

The DoubleAgent module consists of four components: core, resources, stats, and logs. You may
load the default components (core, resources and stats) with:

    require 'double_agent'

or require them individually:

    require 'double_agent/<name>'

Finally, you may require every possible component with:

    require 'double_agent/all'

= Core

The core parser.

    ua_string = "pretent I'm a user agent string for Firefox 4 on Ubuntu"

    DoubleAgent.browser(ua_string)
    => "Firefox 4"

    DoubleAgent.browser_family(ua_string)
    => "Firefox"

    DoubleAgent.browser_sym(ua_string)
    => :firefox_4

    DoubleAgent.browser_family_sym(ua_string)
    => :firefox

    DoubleAgent.os(ua_string)
    => "Ubuntu"

    DoubleAgent.os_family(ua_string)
    => "GNU/Linux"

    DoubleAgent.os_sym(ua_string)
    => :ubuntu

    DoubleAgent.os_family_sym(ua_string)
    => :linux

= Resources

Say you're saving a record of each user's login so you can determine their favorite browser. Just make sure
the user agent is avilable through #user_agent, and presto!

    class Login
      include DoubleAgent::Resource

      def user_agent
        #returns this object's user agent string
      end
    end

    login = Login.find(76)

    login.browser
    => "Firefox 4"

    login.os_family
    => "OS X"

= Stats

Figure out what percent of DoubleAgent::Resource'd objects use which browser, browser family, os, 
etc., or any combination of these.

== Example 1

    logins = Login.all
    stats = DoubleAgent.percentages_for(logins, :browser)
    stats.each do |browser, percent|
      puts "#{browser} - #{percent}%"
    end

    Firefox 4 - 20%
    Internet Explorer 8 - 18%
    ...

== Example 2

    logins = Login.all
    stats = DoubleAgent.percentages_for(logins, :browser_family, :os_family)
    stats.each do |browser_family, os_family, percent|
      puts "#{browser_family} on #{os_family} - #{percent}%"
    end

    Firefox on Windows - 50%
    Internet Explorer on Window - 20%
    Safari on OS X - 20%
    Firefox on GNU/Linux - 10%

= Logs

double_agent/logs is an optional component you must require manually. It contains a
simple DoubleAgent::LogEntry class representing one line in an Apache or Nginx access log, storing
the user agent in its user_agent attr. As you might guess, it includes DoubleAgent::Resource, 
so it has all the browser and os methods.

    require 'double_agent'
    require 'double_agent/logs'

    entries = DoubleAgent.log_entries("/var/log/nginx/my-site.access.log*")
    entries.each do |entry|
      puts entry.browser
    end

    Firefox 3
    Internet Explorer 8
    Internet Explorer 9
    Firefox 4
    Internet Explorer
    Safari
    Chrome
    ...
