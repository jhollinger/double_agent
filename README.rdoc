= Double Agent

double_agent is a library for parsing browser and operating system info out of user 
agent strings. It is designed for parsing large sets for review or analysis.

*NOTE* Support for Ruby 1.8 was dropped after version 0.2.3.

== Installation

    [sudo] gem install double_agent
    # Or add "double_agent" to your Gemfile

Read the full documentation at http://jordanhollinger.com/docs/double_agent/

== Parser

    user_agent = DoubleAgent.parse("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/12.04 Chromium/18.0.1025.168 Chrome/18.0.1025.168 Safari/535.19")

    user_agent.browser
    => "Chrome 18"

    user_agent.browser_family
    => "Chromium"

    user_agent.os
    => "Ubuntu"

    user_agent.os_family
    => "GNU/Linux"

    user_agent.mobile?
    => false

    # Or

    DoubleAgent.browser("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/12.04 Chromium/18.0.1025.168 Chrome/18.0.1025.168 Safari/535.19")
    => "Chrome 18"

See the DoubleAgent module for more info.

== Resources

DoubleAgent::Resource is a mix-in for objects with a user_agent method.
It gives that class's objects all of the above methods and more.

    class Login
      include DoubleAgent::Resource

      def user_agent
        #returns the user agent string the user logged in with
      end
    end

    login = Login.find(76)

    login.browser
    => "Firefox 4"

    login.os_family
    => "OS X"

See the DoubleAgent::Resource module for more info.

== Logs

DoubleAgent includes a small log parser, for parsing user agent strings out of http server access logs. It even reads gzipped logs (requires zlib)!
It returns an array of DoubleAgent::LogEntry classes, which mixes in DoubleAgent::Resource.

    # Parse the logs
    entries = DoubleAgent.logs("/var/log/nginx/my-site.access.log*")

    # Use a tool like Graphene to calculate stats
    puts Graphene.percentages(entries, :browser)
    => [["Firefox 4", 20.0, 650], ["Internet Explorer 8", 18.0, 587], ...]

Check out the DoubleAgent::LogEntry class for more methods besides user_agent.

== Where did stats go?

As of version 1.0.0, double_agent underwent a downsizing. Stats were dropped and moved to their own more generic gem called Graphene. More info at https://github.com/jhollinger/graphene.
